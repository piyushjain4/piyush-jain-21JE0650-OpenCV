## Description

This project utilizes OpenCV to detect square shapes in images  and overlays ArUco markers on top of the detected squares. ArUco markers are a type of fiducial marker that are commonly used in computer vision applications for object tracking and localization.

The main goal of this project is to showcase how to combine shape detection with marker placement, providing a visual representation of the detected squares.

## Features

- Detects square shapes in images 
- Places ArUco markers on top of detected squares for visualization.
  
# Aruco placement

The purpose of the project is to autonomously place aruco markers on square boxes .
The code is written such that there is no need to change the orientation of the boxes to exactly overlapp arucomarkers on the boxes.
